# Code Sample: ECE-Dashboard

## Overview

This was a dashboard I created at my previous job for a project analyzing costs at early childcare centers. Our client had originally requested a series of static plots displaying the allocation of costs between different combinations of center functions. Since it sounded like there would be a lot of redundancy in the plots, I proposed that we deliver an interactive dashboard instead. I designed this dashboard in conjunction with the project researchers who provided insight on what sections of the data would be most helpful to display for the client. We went through several iterations of the dashboard, each time adding in additional features the client requested. These requested features include being able to exclude one center with outlier values, being able to sort by various measure scores, and having an extra bar with averaged values at the bottom of each plot.    
      
This version of the dashboard uses random fake data since the original data belonged to the project. As such, the numbers in this version may not necessarily make sense in context, and simply serve as dummy values for display.
